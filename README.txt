Hi-Lo Guessing Game Project, created by Manny Flores

This project is written in IJVM Machine code, and consists of a game between two players. The first player must enter a number between 0 and 99,
then the second player must take up to ten guesses to guess that number (NOTE: ensure you delete the number from the input console, otherwise
it won't be as much of a guessing game!) The program will output "Too big", or "Too small" if the guessed number is bigger or smaller than the 
player 1's number, and "Invalid input" if the guessed number is out of bounds or has any non-numeric characters.

If the player guesses the number, it will print a message acknowledging this, and the number of guesses it took. If the player takes too many
guesses, it will print that the player lost, and display the correct number. Then it will ask if the player wishes to play again. If the player
enters 'y' at this point, it will restart the program. If the player enters 'n', the program will end.
